!!! info "Written for Fusion"

    The CAD section is currently written for Fusion only. If you would like to add information for another CAD software, consider opening an issue in this website's repository so that we can cleanly add more information.

## What is CAD?
Computer-Aided Design (CAD) is software used to create precise 3D models of parts and assemblies. For robotics, CAD is an essential part of the design process, allowing teams to plan their entire robot and design components for manufacturing, such as 3D printing, laser cutting, or other fabrication methods.

### Why CAD is important in FTC
- **Plan out builds**: CAD allows you to plan out your entire robot, allowing you to have a plan before ever beginning construction.  
- **Material costs**: Having an accurate model lets you know exactly what you need to purchase, saving time and money.  
- **Communication**: CAD makes sharing ideas simpler, as you can simply CAD an idea you have.  
- **Fabrication**: Creating an exact CAD model of a part you need gives you access to numerous manufacturing methods, such as 3D Printing, Laser cutting, and many more.  
- **Engineering Portfolio**: Most CAD software will save version histories and changes, enabling you to capture your design process at any stage.

### Real-World Advantages
CAD is used by real engineers and product designers. Even if you're only modeling basic designs, you’re developing skills that are valuable beyond robotics.  

- **Future-Proof Skills**: Learn tools used in mechanical engineering and product design.  
- **Collaboration**: CAD makes it easy to collaborate, and working together on a robot design helps build strong teamwork skills.  
- **Prototyping**: Use an iterative design process to create better models and save time building and testing.

## Choosing the Right CAD Software
Not all tools are the same. These are some that FTC teams commonly use, many of which are free for students:  

- **Onshape**: Fully cloud-based, no downloads needed, excellent for teams, similar to Fusion but fewer features.  
- **Fusion 360**: Feature-dense, desktop-based CAD/CAM software, good collaboration tools, simple learning curve.  
- **SolidWorks**: Professional-grade tool, available through FIRST grants, extreme learning curve.  
- **TinkerCAD**: Extremely simple and beginner-friendly, but limited in complexity.

## Tips for Getting Started with CAD
It can be overwhelming at first, so start small and build up:  

- **Model One system at a Time**: Start with a drivetrain or intake.  
- **Use Official STEP Files**: Save time by importing accurate models of REV, goBILDA, or other components from their product page, usually marked as STEP Files.  
- **Collaborate**: Onshape and Fusion 360 allow multiple team members to work on the same design.  
- **Save Often**: Don’t spend 2 hours on a design only to lose all your work.  
- **Name Your Files Clearly**: Avoid confusion when working with complex assemblies and shared folders.

## CAD and FTC Awards
Judges are always looking for evidence of thoughtful engineering. CAD shows you didn’t just guess.  

- **Think Award**: This award means you demonstrated your documentation and design process, both of which are supported heavily by CAD.  
- **Design and Innovate Awards**: Highlights clever or unique design elements, both of which are often created during the CAD process.  
- **Inspire Award**: A well-documented, CAD-supported build reflects a strong overall team.

!!! tip "Bonus Tip"

    Label your renders. A clear image with callouts or annotations can be worth more than a full paragraph.

## Recap
Whether you’re a rookie team or not, using CAD is one of the most effective ways to take your engineering process to the next level. It helps you build better robots, work better as a team, and stand out in judging rooms.
