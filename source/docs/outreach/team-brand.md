# Team Brand

Branding your team will allow you to become more recognizable in the community.

## Elements of Team Branding
Your team brand can have many different elements, all of which help make your team more recognizable:

### Name
The name of your team is one half of how others will refer to you verbally, so it's important to have a team name that is an accurate representation of your team.

### Team Number
Your team number is the other half of how people will refer to you. Incorporating your team number into your brand can help with recognition since team numbers are often the only way teams are identified, such as on the robot, or on match schedules.

### Logo
Your logo is the symbol that identifies your team. During a match, it is displayed next to your team number.

### Fonts
Having a set font allows you to set your documents and slideshows apart, as it ties the look of the content to your brand.

### Colors
Picking a color and sticking with it allows you to make document your brand makes more consistent and recognizable.
