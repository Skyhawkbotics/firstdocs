## About Team Branding

Your team brand is more than just a logo and colors—it's how your team presents itself to your community, and the world. A strong and consistent brand helps potential sponsors, other teams, judges andd your community remember who you are, what you stand for and what makes you unique. A team brand done right can support the Motivate, Connect, and Inspire awards.

## Elements of Team Branding
Your team brand can have many different elements, all of which help make your team more recognizable:

### Name
The name of your team is one half of how others will refer to you verbally, so it's important to have a team name that is an accurate representation of your team.

### Team Number
Your team number is the other half of how people will refer to you. Incorporating your team number into your brand can help with recognition since team numbers are often the only way teams are identified, such as on the robot, or on match schedules.

### Logo
Your logo is the symbol that identifies your team. During a match, it is displayed next to your team number.
