# Outreach Overview

## What Outreach Is
In the FIRST Tech Challenge, outreach refers to the efforts a team makes to connect with people outside of their team to spread awareness of STEM, robotics, FIRST, and their core values of Gracious Professionalism and Coopertition. 

Outreach is intentional, mission-driven, and more than just giving back. It is about building a lasting impact and making a difference that aligns with the mission, goals and values of FIRST.

### Common Forms of Outreach
Outreach comes in many forms, such as:

#### Promoting STEM in the Community
Sharing STEM concepts with the public to build interest, understanding and enthusiasm in the community, especially amoung younger students.

!!! example "Examples"

    - Give live robot demos at schools, libraries, or community events
    - Host STEM nights or interactive booths at local fairs
    - Organize robotics camps or weekend workshops for younger students
    - Create educational content (videos, presentations, blog posts) about STEM
    - Offer “Intro to Robotics” sessions for students or parents

#### Mentoring & Supporting Other Teams
Providing guidance, knowledge and assistance to other teams to help them succeed and grow. The teams you support don't have to be limited to rookie FTC teams, as your team can also mentor FLL and even FRC teams.

!!! example "Examples"

    - Guide rookie FTC or FLL teams through build season
    - Help new teams with programming, design, or judging prep
    - Share resources like CAD files, code libraries, or documentation tips
    - Host scrimmages, strategy sessions, or open-house pit tours
    - Offer regular check-ins, Q&A calls, or virtual office hours

#### Building Partnerships
Building partnerships is an essential part of outreach, as connecting with other organizations and individuals can allow both parties to benefit.

!!! example "Examples"

    - Present your team’s mission to local businesses or STEM orgs
    - Invite sponsors to events, competitions, or team meetings
    - Collaborate with nonprofits for co-hosted outreach events
    - Connect with engineers or professionals for mentorship or workshops
    - Form relationships with universities or tech programs
#### Increasing Access & Inclusion
Expanding opportunities for underserved and underrepresented groups to engage in robotics and STEM by reducing barriers related to access, language, or resources.

!!! example "Examples"

    - Bring robotics to schools or youth groups in underserved areas
    - Provide translated materials or multi-language demos
    - Partner with organizations focused on diversity in STEM
    - Donate kits, parts, or mentoring time to low-resourced teams
    - Advocate for accessibility in STEM spaces and competitions

#### Spreading FIRST Values
Promoting and demonstrating FIRST’s core values in your team’s culture, outreach events, and public communications. This includes actively sharing what makes FIRST meaningful.

!!! example "Examples"

    - Teach Gracious Professionalism® and Coopertition® through your actions
    - Share how robotics builds leadership, teamwork, and resilience
    - Speak at community meetings about the impact of FIRST programs
    - Empower younger students to start/join FIRST teams
    - Promote FIRST’s mission through social media, newsletters, and events

### Outreach Misconceptions
It's important to remember that outreach is *not* just simply "helping others". Outreach *is* about:

- Creating real-world impact in the community
- Showing the judges how your team has an impact outside of competitions
- Building long-term relationships with people, other teams, and organizations

!!! warning "Keep Your Outreach Focused!"

    As you plan your outreach, make sure your efforts are have a meaningful connection to STEM, robotics, and the mission of FIRST. While volunteering in general can be valuable, outreach that supports STEM education and promotes the values of FIRST will have a greater impact—and aligns more closely with judged awards like Inspire, Connect, and Motivate. It is very easy to lose sight of your outreach mission. Always ask: *"How does this help spread STEM or FIRST?"*

## Why It Matters
Outreach is more than just a good thing to do or helping others—it is an important and strategic part of being a successful FTC team. Remember, the most competitive and recognized teams build more than just great robots; they also build relationships, community presence, and impact.

Strong outreach indicates to the judges that your team is well-rounded, mission-driven, and making a difference beyond the field.

### Awards
meaningful outreach is a key component for winning judged awards, such as:

- **Inspire Award**: The Inspire Award is the highest award an FTC team can earn, as it judges outreach, engineering and documentation.
- **Motivate Award:** The Motivate Award is judged based on how much the team sparks FIRST interest in others.
- **Connect Award:** The Connect Award is judged based on how the team connects with the STEM and engineering community.

!!! tip "Don't Disregard Awards!"

    Pursuing awards can help you advance even if your robot doesn't perform well. Consult the game manual to determine which awards are eligible for advancement in your upcoming tournament. Outreach could be the edge that keeps your season going!
