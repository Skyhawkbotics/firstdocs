# Using Git

Git is a version control system for your code that manages changes over time. It makes it easier for multiple people to work on code together, keeps track of your edits, and allows you to roll back to working code if something breaks.

!!! info "Mind the Platform"

    This guide assumes you are using GitHub as your git server. If you are using a different platform (such as GitLab), most of the git-related steps are still the same, but there may be some variations.

## Advantages of Git
Using git, especially in the FIRST Tech Challenge has many advantages, such as:

- Allowing for quick and easy rollbacks if a mistake is made
- Making it easier and safer for multiple people to work on a codebase
- Recording a history as the code evolves, which can potentially be used as evidence for awards
- Making experimenting safer, as new ideas can be tried in a different branch without breaking the main code
